<p class="title">Rules</p>
<p class="info">Shady Grove is a small campground with customers frequently tiring from longs days of activity, because of this we enforce a "no party" policy. Many people camp here because of the rules. If you find problems with our rules, we would gladly help you find a different suitable location.</p>
<p class="info">
THESE RULES ARE STRICTLY ENFORCED.  Anyone violating these rules--even for the first time--may be asked to leave the campground and will be subject to revocation of further campground privileges.
</p>
</div>


<div id="right">
<ol class="rightlist">
	<li>Absolutely no activity at any time which disrupts the tranquility of the campground.  For instance, absolutely no public intoxication or foul language ever. </li><br/>
    <li>ENTRANCE PERMITS.  No unregistered guests or vehicles without Entrance Permits on their rear-view mirrors are ever to be in the campground.  If you observe vehicles without Permits or observe behavior not in keeping with the spirit of Shady Grove, please report it ASAP.</li><br/>
    <li>10 P.M. QUIET TIME.  Quiet, conversational sounds only heard from one site into another.  Activities start winding down by 10 P.M. so that by the Midnight Curfew, the campground is quiet.</li><br/>
    <li>MIDNIGHT CURFEW.  By "curfew" we mean ALL ACTIVITY AND NOISE HAS CEASED.  All social gatherings must have ended.  All campfires and lights have been extinguished.  (Please notice the use of past tenses.) </li><br/>
    <li>CHILDREN:  No children or pets left unattended, ever!  Children in or near the river will be closely attended by an adult.  PETS:  Only QUIET, well-mannered dogs ON LEASHES at all times and well-mannered, considerate owners using "pooper scoopers" are allowed. </li><br/>
    <li>No amplified music at any time.  No radios or boomboxes ever.  No usage whatsoever of generators or similar devices after 10 P.M. </li><br/>
    <li>No glass containers, no littering, no firearms, no fireworks, and no off-road vehicles.</li><br/>
    <li>All DAY USE ENDS AT 9 P.M.    OVERNIGHT check-out time is 12 NOON.</li>
